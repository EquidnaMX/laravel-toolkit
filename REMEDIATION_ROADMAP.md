# Remediation Roadmap

| Finding | Task | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| README duplicated content and omitted middleware/strategy details. | Rewrite README with accurate overview, configuration, usage, and middleware/strategy guidance. | ✅ Completed |
| Routes documentation cited test fakes instead of the default detector and lacked matcher clarity. | Document `ConfigurableRouteDetector`, default matchers, and integration expectations. | ✅ Completed |
| Deployment guide did not mention boot-time validation or optional middleware wiring. | Expand deployment instructions with configuration validation notes and middleware registration options. | ✅ Completed |
| Tests documentation referenced a `tests/Unit` layout that does not exist. | Update test structure section and include tooling commands for PHPUnit, PHPStan, and PHPCS. | ✅ Completed |
| Open questions/assumptions were vague about publishable artifacts and route presets. | Clarify current assumptions and call out where custom matchers or monitoring hooks may be needed. | ✅ Completed |
